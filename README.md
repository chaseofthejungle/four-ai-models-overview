## 2. <a name="generative">Generative AIs</a>

*Generative AIs* (Gen AIs) do not quite have independence, but they can take input and associated predictions and generate information from them by recognizing patterns and operating with consideration of latent spaces.

Gen AI can be mapped out in terms of seven steps:

1) **Collecting Input/Initial Data**
2) **Featuring Mapping** (transforming the data into a format that Gen AI models can use to generate new content)
3) **Pattern Identification and Learning**
4) **Content Creation**
5) **Adaptation** (taking into consideration what was learned and relevant predictions)
6) **Output Generation**
7) **Feedback from Users**

## 3. <a name="aiagents">AI Agents</a>

*AI Agents* are structured around task/process goal-driven actions and intentions, branching beyond being simple prompt-response mechanisms. They use bult-in logic to determine users' objectives, gather data/results, and select APIs and other AI tools that make sense for problem solving.

AI Agents can be mapped out in terms of seven steps:

1) **A Task/Process is Triggered**
2) **The Intention/Goal of the Task is Detected**
3) **The Model or Rule is Executed**
4) **An API or Other AI Tool is Called**
5) **A Result/Output is Generated**
6) **The Response is Handled**
7) **The Task/Process is Logged**

## 4. <a name="agentic">Agentic AIs</a>

*Agentic AIs* emulate autonomous reasoning, and thus are quite complex: they plan and reach decisions (without human intervention) based on goals/outcomes, change course of action/strategy, artificially comprehend context and constraints/limits, and instantly orchestrate other AI tools.

## 5. <a name="llm">Large Language Models (LLMs)</a>

*LLMs* are core-level, multi-functional, contextual and computational engines, performing a variety of tasks such as: neural inferencing/predicting, tokenization, and embedding.
