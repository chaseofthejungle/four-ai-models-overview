## 2. <a name="generative">Generative AIs</a>

*Generative AIs* do not quite have independence, but they can take input and associated predictions and generate information from them by recognizing patterns and operating with consideration of latent spaces.

<hr />

## 3. <a name="aiagents">AI Agents</a>

*AI Agents* are structured around task/process goal-driven actions and intentions, branching beyond being simple prompt-response mechanisms. They use bult-in logic to determine users' objectives, gather data/results, and select APIs and other AI tools that make sense for problem solving.

<hr />

## 4. <a name="agentic">Agentic AIs</a>

*Agentic AIs* emulate autonomous reasoning, and thus are quite complex: they plan and reach decisions (without human intervention) based on goals/outcomes, change course of action/strategy, artificially comprehend context and constraints/limits, and instantly orchestrate other AI tools.

<hr />

## 5. <a name="llm">Large Language Models (LLMs)</a>

*LLMs* are core-level, multi-functional, contextual and computational engines, performing a variety of tasks such as: neural inferencing/predicting, tokenization, and embedding.
