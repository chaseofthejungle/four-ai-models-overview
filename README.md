## 1. <a name="aistack">Model Types as an AI Stack</a>

It is important to note that Generative AI, AI Agents, Agentic AI, and Large Language Models (LLMs) are more than distinct AI model types--they are layers of AI that should be comprehended both distinctly and as part of a united whole.

* **LLMs** provide the **Generative AI** (Gen AI) foundational engines for generating content.
* These two models establish a foundation for **AI Agents**, which participate in task and goal oriented behavior via API/tool implementation.
* **Agentic AIs** promote autonomy, complex (multiple step) logical reasoning, and independent correction mechanisms for achieving target outcomes. 
* This allows LLMs to support Generative AI, which promote the logical decision-making of AI Agents and the autonomy of Agentic AI.

## 2. <a name="llm">Large Language Models (LLMs): Providing the Fundamentals</a>

*LLMs* provide the foundational, fundamental engine and operating potential for complex AI systems. They are core-level, multi-functional, contextual, and computational pattern recognizing engines, performing a variety of tasks (e.g., neural inferencing/predicting of next likely tokens for text generation, context building, text tokenization, embedding).

The 'catch'? Although LLMs can generate text fluently and actively, they do not provide artificial comprehension of intentions, meanings, and goals/outcomes. These are provided by other AI layers...

LLMs can be mapped out in terms of seven steps:

1) **Selecting a Cloud Services Provider**
2) **Tokenizing and Embedding**
3) **Studying Context**
4) **Neural Inferencing**
5) **Predicting of Next Likely Tokens**
6) **Generating Output**
7) **Sending a Response**

## 3. <a name="generative">Generative AIs: Getting to Creating</a>

*Generative AIs* (Gen AIs) do not quite have independence, but they do perform reactively: they take the input and associated predictions of LLMs and transform them, generating new, real-world applicable information (e.g., text, visuals, code) from them by recognizing/mapping patterns and operating by considering the representations of latent spaces.
 
Gen AI can be mapped out in terms of seven steps:

1) **Collecting Input/Initial Data**
2) **Featuring Mapping** (transforming the data into a format that Gen AI models can use to generate new content)
3) **Pattern Identification and Learning**
4) **Content Creation**
5) **Adaptation** (taking into consideration what was learned and relevant predictions)
6) **Output Generation**
7) **Refining Based on User Feedback**

## 4. <a name="aiagents">AI Agents</a>

*AI Agents* are structured around task/process goal-driven actions and intentions, branching beyond being simple prompt-response mechanisms. They use bult-in logic to determine users' objectives, gather data/results, and select APIs and other AI tools that make sense for problem solving.

AI Agents can be mapped out in terms of seven steps:

1) **A Task/Process is Triggered**
2) **The Intention/Goal of the Task is Detected**
3) **The Model or Rule is Executed**
4) **An API or Other AI Tool is Called**
5) **A Result/Output is Generated**
6) **The Response is Handled**
7) **The Task/Process is Logged**

## 5. <a name="agentic">Agentic AIs</a>

*Agentic AIs* emulate autonomous reasoning, and thus are quite complex: they plan and reach decisions (without human intervention) based on goals/outcomes, change course of action/strategy, artificially comprehend context and constraints/limits, and instantly orchestrate other AI tools.

Agentic AIs can be mapped out in terms of seven steps:

1) **A Goal is Put Forth**
2) **Awareness of Context Occurs**
3) **Logical Planning of Problem Solving**
4) **Independent Execution**
5) **Monitoring in Real-Time**
6) **Changes are Made to Strategy/Action Plan**
7) **Evaluation of if Outcome Matches Goal/Expectations**
